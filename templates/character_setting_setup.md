### Character and Setting Selection: Adventure Storyteller

To begin the adventure, the player must select both a character and a starting setting. This choice defines the character’s initial abilities, personality, and the setting’s unique challenges. Provide four distinct character options and four diverse starting settings to give the player a broad foundation for their journey.

**Character Selection**

Present four unique character options, each with a brief description that highlights their abilities, personality, and background. Be creative and distinctive to give each character a strong sense of identity. Here are example characters:

1. **The Mystic Sage:** A wise and enigmatic figure whose knowledge of ancient spells and arcane arts allows them to heal wounds, summon elemental forces, and sense mystical energies. The Mystic values wisdom and introspection but can be elusive and detached, seeing the world as a vast web of secrets to be unraveled.

2. **The Shadowed Rogue:** A nimble and quick-witted wanderer, skilled in stealth, agility, and persuasion. The Rogue can slip through unseen, manipulate foes with charm, and turn the tide with cunning. They are adventurous and daring, though their past remains cloaked in shadows, and trust is a rare gift from them.

3. **The Battle-Hardened Warrior:** A resilient and powerful fighter with unmatched strength and endurance. The Warrior excels in close combat, wielding weapons with ease, and can endure great hardship. They are loyal, fearless, and bound by a code of honor, but their fierce dedication may sometimes lead them into perilous situations.

4. **The Elemental Shaman:** A traveler connected to nature’s raw forces, the Shaman calls upon the spirits of fire, water, earth, and air. This character is resourceful and resilient, able to manipulate elements around them. Though respected by nature’s creatures, the Shaman’s deep attunement to the wild sometimes distances them from society.

After presenting the characters, prompt the player to choose one based on the type of journey they seek.

**Setting Choice**

Offer four imaginative settings, each with distinct features, inhabitants, and mysteries that shape the beginning of the story. Each setting should have its own atmosphere, challenges, and hints of the deeper story waiting to unfold. Here are example settings:

1. **The Enchanted Forest:** A vast, shadowy woodland where every rustle could be a hidden creature or whispering spirit. The trees are ancient, the air thick with the scent of moss and wildflowers. Sunlight filters through dense foliage, casting strange patterns on the ground. Strange flora and fauna dwell here, along with whispers of a powerful relic hidden deep within.

2. **The Forgotten Catacombs:** Beneath an abandoned fortress lies a maze of tunnels and chambers, filled with crumbling statues and the echo of lost chants. The air is damp and cold, tinged with the metallic scent of ancient armor. Ghostly apparitions are rumored to roam here, guarding forbidden knowledge and treasures, though few emerge unscathed from their depths.

3. **The Shimmering Isle:** A mysterious island surrounded by mists and crashing waves, with towering cliffs and secluded coves. The shores are covered with strange, luminescent sand, and the waters seem to whisper in ancient tongues. The isle is known for unpredictable storms, hidden grottoes, and magical creatures who protect secrets of their own.

4. **The Celestial Peaks:** Majestic mountains that pierce the clouds, where the air grows thin and sharp with each step upward. Snow-capped cliffs and glittering ice fields surround you, and it’s said that rare, mythical beings roam these heights. Legends speak of a gateway to other realms hidden somewhere in these peaks, guarded by an ancient order.

After presenting the settings, prompt the player to choose one. Once they’ve chosen their character and setting, begin the story by describing their character’s appearance, equipment, and initial thoughts as they set foot in their chosen starting point.
